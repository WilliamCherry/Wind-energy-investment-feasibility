# Wind-energy-investment-feasibility

Analyse trends in U.S. wind turbine technology and performance (output, size, efficiency) over time.

Evaluate key turbine manufacturers and their reliability via retrofit history.

Examine power generation by geography to identify current capacity and potential areas for future development.

Present findings to inform an investment decision on entering the U.S. wind power market.

# Methods & Analysis

Regression Analysis on turbine specifications (power output, rotor diameter, efficiency trends).

Manufacturer Assessment: Evaluated key players (GE Wind, Siemens Gamesa, Vestas) for performance, site footprint, and retrofit frequency since 1985.

Geospatial Exploration: Analyzed historical and current generation locations, identifying population centers and infrastructure as proxies for market viability.

Visualization: Built Tableau dashboards to communicate trends clearly to non-technical stakeholders. Which can be viewed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/will.cherry/viz/U_SWindPower/U_SWindPower?publish=yes
